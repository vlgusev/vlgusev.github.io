My research focuses on material discovery through the lens of computer science. 
I work on optimisation algorithms and machine learning approaches
to accelerate workflows and help to address global challenges through technology.
My broader theory interests cover algorithmic, complexity and combinatorial questions 
about discrete structures including graphs, automata, matrices, strings, codes and groups.

Previously, I was a theme lead at the 
<a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/leverhulme-research-centre/"> 
Leverhulme research centre</a> for functional materials design
working with <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/cooper-group/"> Andy Cooper </a>
and <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/chemistry/research/rosseinsky-group/">
Matthew Rosseinsky</a>.
Before that, I was a postdoc at the UCLouvain cyber-physical systems lab
with <a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/raphael.jungers/content/home">RaphaÃ«l Jungers</a>.
I did my PhD with <a href="http://csseminar.kmath.ru/volkov/">Mikhail Volkov</a> at the Ural Federal University.
